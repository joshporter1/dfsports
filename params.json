I rely heavily on the podcasts, as the guys who host them are the same ones who run the paid sites. Their insights are incredibly useful for building lineups. Beware they can be wrong sometimes, since it's all predictive and nothing is certain, so take their advice with a grain of salt. \r\n\r\nSome general advice for approaching Daily Fantasy Sports.\r\n- **Start small.** If you're new, you want to build your bankroll without risking it all. Once you get a few winning weeks under your belt (and more money in your bankroll) then you can start ramping up your entries.\r\n- **Keep a low ratio of Tournaments to Cash.** I typically do an 80/20 or 85/15 split of cash games and tournaments. This allows you to maintain your bankroll with the cash games, while still throwing money at the big-win tournaments.\r\n- **Read the news!** As with season-long fantasy, you want to watch the player news. Knowing a guy might not play a lot or a guy is filling in for an injured starter can make or break your week. \r\n- **Have common sense.** Just because Ryan Fitzpatrick is playing the Cleveland Browns doesn't mean you should necessarily use him. The matchup might be perfect, but playing a scrub against a bad team doesn't mean he'll do well.\r\n- **Ignore Davis Mattek** He's a host on the Fantasy Insiders podcasts, the one with a higher pitched voice. Ignore his advice, it's awful. The only thing he brings to those podcasts is some humor. \r\n\r\nBesides these basic tips, the podcasts commonly go over more in-depth strategy.\r\n\r\n## DFS Terminology\r\nDFS blogs, podcasts, and websites use a few terms that may mean something in other contexts. Below are the \"DFS\" definitions. \r\n#### Game Terms\r\n- **DFS** Daily Fantasy Sports\r\n- **Cash games** contests that pay out smaller amounts to a broad swath of the entrants\r\n- **GPP** Guaranteed Prize Pool, a game type where the prizes are guaranteed no matter what (even if the lobby doesn't fill). These typically pay out the top ~10% in larger amounts\r\n- **50/50** a game type where the top 50% of entrants are paid out the same amount (usually double the entry fee minus commission)\r\n- **Double-up** a game type where roughly the top 40% of players are paid out double the entry fee\r\n- **Head-to-head** a game type where you play a person 1v1. Winner gets double minus commission. Be careful entering these as you cannot cancel your entry.\r\n\r\n#### Strategy and Player terms\r\n- **Chalk** players that are likely to be high-owned (ex: Antonio Brown vs the Browns)\r\n- **Fade** to avoid a player because you think they will be highly owned or underperform\r\n- **Value** the amount of points a player is projected to score in relation to their salary\r\n- **Punt** choosing a low-price player knowing they won't score a lot. This allows you to save at one roster spot to spend up at another\r\n\r\nMore definitions can be found [here](http://www.4for4.com/fantasy-football/daily-fantasy-dfs-glossary-terms)\r\n\r\n## DFS Podcasts\r\n[The Daily Fantasy Football Edge](http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-daily-fantasy-sports-edge/the-daily-fantasy-football-edge)\r\n\r\n[The Insiders Fantasy Football Podcast](http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-insiders-fantasy-football-podcast/)\r\n\r\n[FantasyLabs Podcast](http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/fantasy-labs-2/fantasy-labs-podcast)\r\n\r\n[DFS MVP](http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/4for4-fantasy-football/dfs-mvp-daily-fantasy-sports-most-valuable-podcast)\r\n\r\n## Websites and Blogs\r\n[Anything by Adam Levitan](https://playbook.draftkings.com/author/adam-levitan)\r\n\r\n[RotoGrinders](https://rotogrinders.com)\r\n\r\n[DFSports Subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/dfsports)\r\n\r\n## Useful Tools\r\n\r\n[BeastDFS Excel Spreadsheets](http://www.beastdfs.com/fanduel-cheat-sheet/)\r\n\r\n[Bankroll Tracker](https://rotogrinders.com/bankroll-tracker)\r\n\r\n",
