Below are the \"DFS\" definitions. \r\n##### Game Terms\r\n- **DFS** Daily Fantasy Sports\r\n- **Cash games** contests that pay out smaller amounts to a broad swath of the entrants\r\n- **GPP** Guaranteed Prize Pool, a game type where the prizes are guaranteed no matter what (even if the lobby doesn't fill). These typically pay out the top ~10% in larger amounts\r\n- **50/50** a game type where the top 50% of entrants are paid out the same amount (usually double the entry fee minus commission)\r\n- **Double-up** a game type where roughly the top 40% of players are paid out double the entry fee\r\n- **Head-to-head** a game type where you play a person 1v1. Winner gets double minus commission\r\n\r\n##### Strategy and Player terms\r\n- **Chalk** players that are likely to be high-owned (ex: Antonio Brown vs the Browns)\r\n- **Fade** to avoid a player because you think they will be highly owned or underperform\r\n- **Value** the amount of points a player is projected to score in relation to their salary\r\n\r\nMore definitions can be found [here](http://www.4for4.com/fantasy-football/daily-fantasy-dfs-glossary-terms)\r\n\r\n### DFS Podcasts\r\n[The Daily Fantasy Football Edge](http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-daily-fantasy-sports-edge/the-daily-fantasy-football-edge)\r\n\r\n[The Insiders Fantasy Football Podcast](http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-insiders-fantasy-football-podcast/)\r\n\r\n[FantasyLabs Podcast](http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/fantasy-labs-2/fantasy-labs-podcast)\r\n\r\n### Websites and Blogs\r\n[RotoGrinders](https://rotogrinders.com)\r\n\r\n[DFSports Subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/dfsports)\r\n\r\n### Useful Tools\r\n\r\n[BeastDFS Excel Spreadsheets](http://www.beastdfs.com/fanduel-cheat-sheet/)\r\n\r\n[Bankroll Tracker](https://rotogrinders.com/bankroll-tracker)\r\n\r\n",
